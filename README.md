# About
ETMS or Emergency Traffic-light Management System was a project developed in the Egyption AIO 2024 (an ARA Competition) that ensured a safe route to vehicles and the fastest route to the emergency vehicles without the need of a separte Maps.

# The Start
It all started with 2 Teenagers that want to win this competition, Osama and youssef (with the help of @ctrldon and Omar gamal). Both of them wanted to create a new, valuable idea in the project rahter than just a random copy paste project that was done everywhere!
The aim of the project was simple, do the best embeded system project about smart cities to win the competition.
So we thought about what to do as our idea. Time passed, with a lot of brainstorming we landed a very senstive Idea. Smart cities are extremly good when it comes to the luxoury, but when an emergency happen everything starts to get random, espically when an emergency vehicle moves in the streets, things get extremly unpredictable which may cause more and more damage. The idea was simple, each vehicle will tell a certain embeded system inside the vehichle where is the starting and the ending point, and the system automatically opens the right traffic light(s) for the vehicle, and based on the of the criticality it has we automate the time of the opennes and how much early will the traffic light will be green in the vehicle lane. The idea was grate, but we didnt have time to finish the whole idea at that competition, and we had IGCSE Exams so we weren't availlable much at that time!
